### Who we are
We are a group of four really good friends who met and attend the University of Toronto for Computer Science.  We love attending Hackathons together as a team of four and we love what we do as Computer Science students.
### What our app does
Our application takes in a picture of the user's skin taken using their phone camera and uses that picture to conduct a smart inference on what skin condition the user might have based on our trained machine learning model that uses image classification.
### What our app was built with
1. Android studio
2. Java
3. Microsoft Azure Image recognition AI
4. SQLite Database (SQL 3.0)
5. Android
### Inspiration
The inspiration for our application came from our own laziness and unwillingness to go to the doctors for anything. We wanted to create an application with machine learning and artificial intelligence models in order to improve the daily lives of the lazy. Our goal is to create an application to change the future of skin care and self analysis of skin conditions at home.
### What's in store
We would like to increase the accuracy of our current model and we would also like to start including and supporting other well known skin conditions. The end goal of Skinmergency is to get real doctor certification in order to improve trust, and reliability of our machine learning model. We would like to possibly take our application to enterprise and become a trusted source of skin condition diagnoses.
